    "This trace of the history of the network is possibly more complicated than you had been expecting.  The first three rows correspond to the neurons that we added by our calls to the `add_grandmother` methods.  In the first column these three neurons are off (the network is at rest). Then in three successive steps the predicate, the first argument and the second argument are activated.  Finally, in the fifth column, the network is at rest again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why did we choose to activate the neurons in order rather than, say, activate all three at the same time?  The reason is that the network needs to be able to distinguish between 'hug($a$,$b$)' and 'hug($b$,$a$)'.  If all three neurons were activated at the same time both of these would have the same representation.  In the literature on neural representation this is often referred to as $\\textit{the binding problem}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is going on in the lower four rows of the history display?  In creating a neural event of the required type, the network discovered that it needed to create more neurons for book-keeping purposes.  In the first column these neurons were not present in the network and this is represented by the occurrences of `2`.  By the time we get to the second column the additional four neurons have been created.  Creating new neurons like this may seem implausible as a model of what happens in an animal brain.  However, it does not seem so implausible that many neurons in an animal brain are available to be designated as having a certain function.  Thus the creation of new neurons in our computational model could be seen as corresponding to the use of previously unused neurons in an animal brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new neurons are used for bookkeeping purposes.  How do we know that an event on the network of the type represented in the top three rows is in fact the representation of a ptype rather than just a sequence of three representations: of a predicate, followed by a representation of `'a'` and a separate representation of `'b'`.  The three events are tied together by the activation of the neuron labelled `ptype2` (\"ptype with two arguments\") throughout the duration of the three events.  The role of the individual events in the ptype are indicated by the remaining three neurons, labelled `rel`, `arg0` and `arg1` which are active simultaneously with `hug_n`, `a` and `b` respectively.  This means that the order of the three individual events is of itself not important, although the current implementation will always produce them in the order given here.  They could, however, in principle occur in any order preserving the simultaneity of activation of the role-labelling neurons and the neurons `hug_n`, `a` and `b`.  This, then, represents our approach to the binding problem."

    "Note that we now have a collection of book-keeping neurons corresponding to the structure of the function which is the dependent type.  When the neuron `lambda` is active we are in the midst of an event representing a function.  In the first part of the function we represent its domain (`dom`) and its variable (`var`).  These neurons are active simultaneously with the neuron `Ind_n`, encoding the type of the domain of the function. The body of the function is coded by the neuron `rng` (\"range\") which is in fact a two place ptype, as coded by the onset of the first `ptype2` neuron being simultaneous with that of `rng`.  The ptype is coded as before except that the first argument is now indicated to be the variable which was introduced in the function."

    "The activity pattern is displayed as a list of lists of triples.  The first element in each triple is the unique identifier of a neuron.  The second element is the convenient name we have assigned the neuron to make our displays human readable.  The third element is either `1` for activate the neuron or `0` for deactivate.  A list of triple thus represents the activations and deactivations which are to be carried out at one particular time step.  The list of lists represents the activations/deactivations to be carried out over a series of time steps.  Note that if a neuron is activated at one time step it will remain active until it is deactivated at a subsequent time step.  Thus in this pattern neuron `14` (`lambda`) is activated in the first time step and is not deactivated until the final time step."
